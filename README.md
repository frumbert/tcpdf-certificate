# tcpdf-certificate
An example of a basic certificate, such as you might get at the completion of a course, rendered using TCPDF.

You probably want to look at https://tcpdf.org since it has some great examples of every thing under the sun you can do with PDF's. I needed to write text and to place images and to draw borders and that's it - so thats all the example does.

## Running it

on your php web server hit index.php - you'll see the pdf.
